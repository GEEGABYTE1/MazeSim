# MazeSim - An A Star Search Simulation ⭐️

View the A* search algorithm do it's job right from your terminal! Given a graph with 9 nodes placed in different places on the plane, the graph searches the node with the value `*`. With the breadth-first search algorithm, the program has intergated user-inputs, in which a user can input a node from letter `a` to `z` and see the A* algorithm work it's magic. 

The A* algorithm runs in `O(b^d)` time where `b` represents the branching factor, and `d` represents the depth from the start node to the goal node, which is the node with the `*` value integrated. 

# The Graph 

The base graph is implemented as:
